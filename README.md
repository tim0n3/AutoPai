# AutoPai
Lite-touch installation:

## Lite-touch-install
AutoPai installer for Debian-based distros that use the apt package manager.

The project's scripts contain the steps I perform to install and configure a fully-functional raspberrypi to log data and push it up to my company's analytics tool - codenamed fulcrum

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

```
git clone https://github.com/tim0n3/OpenVPN.git ;\
cd AutoPai ;\
chmod +x *.sh ;\
bash AutoPi.sh
```
Once it ends, you can continue adding the certificate into IoT core and ensuring data is pushing into bigQuery
